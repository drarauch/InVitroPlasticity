RNA-seq profiling of human stromal cells in vitro exposed to osteogenic and adipogenic inducers, with focus on the effect of switching the differentiation cocktail.

This site contains R code to re-run the analysis  in the article "Transcriptional plasticity of stromal cells amplifies their differentiation efficiency in vitro".

Processed input data to run the script can be found under https://osf.io/c84vs/.
